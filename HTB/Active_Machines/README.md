# What are HackTheBox's Active Machines?
TLDR; HackTheBox releases boxes periodically, while a machine is **active**, write-ups for it cannot be published and generally diving too deeply into box specifications may get you in trouble.

**Active** boxes are freely accessible contrary to **retired** boxes which require a subscription.

## Reason behind separating Active & Retired Machines
Writing about a box without publicly available solutions showcases the writer's original approach to the challenge.

On another hand, creating a write-up about a machine which's secrets have been exposed to the public does not guarantee the same level of transparency.

## Credibility
To maintain credibility, I will upload password-protected archive containing the write-up, alongside it's checksum BEFORE the machine is retired.
After it's retired the password will be made public. I will also upload the writeup after that for sake of viewers comfort.

This checks all the boxes for credibility, confidentiality ,integrity & availibity *wink wink*.
